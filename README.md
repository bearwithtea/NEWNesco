# NEWNesco - CSC 551 Semester Project
The current UNESCO World Heritage site is clunky, outdated, and frustrating to work with. Unfortunately, this is a poor representation of the purpose of UNESCO, which is to preserve and honor our tradition as human beings. Without a simplistic UI and easily accessible information, people are more likely to forget about these world heritage sites and, more importantly, forget about the great achievements and structures of humanity. Our goal is to take the data and hard work done by the people of UNESCO and transorm it into a cleaner UX via a Django framework, with a social aspect added to encourage people to share their experiences.
